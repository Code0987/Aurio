1. Go to http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/

2. Download 32 and 64 bit shared and dev packages

3. Place contents of shared and dev archives (without root folder) in win32 or win64 subfolder

4. The final folder structure should look like this:

   .(this folder)
   |
   |-- win32
   |   |--bin (containing dlls)
   |   |--include (containing headers in subdirectories)
   |   |--lib (containing libs)
   |
   |-- win64
       |... same as above
